## **Game summary :**
This game is set in ancient China and revolves around an old ritual known as "Ghost Marriage." At the beginning of the story, you play as a young man living in China, who stumbles upon a red envelope lying randomly on the ground. Inside the envelope is a photograph of a young woman along with several strands of her hair. The young man, in his excitement, quickly picks it up, not realizing that this was a marriage proposal from the deceased—a ritual known as "ming hun" (ghost marriage), where families of deceased women seek to find a groom for their departed daughters.
Soon after, the young man is discovered by the deceased girl's family and is hastily forced to become the groom for their daughter. After experiencing strange and unsettling paranormal phenomena, the man realizes that he has been trapped in a large house, bound to live with the ghost of the girl forever.
In this first-person perspective game, you will navigate through the haunted house, solving terrifying mysteries and complex puzzles in a desperate attempt to escape the grasp of the family and their ghostly daughter.

## **Game Play :**

On a gloomy day, with thunder rumbling as if rain was imminent, a young man, exhausted from a hard day, walked home, blaming himself for all the bad luck he had been facing, especially after being scolded by his boss. While on his way, he suddenly noticed a bright red envelope lying on the ground in front of him. Thinking that his streak of bad luck was finally over, he quickly picked it up. But just as he did, a gust of wind blew by, sending a chill down his spine. As soon as he opened the envelope, he shuddered and felt confused upon seeing a picture of a young woman and a few locks of hair inside. Before he could process what was happening, the owner of the red envelope appeared behind him, covering his face with a cloth soaked in chloroform. Everything quickly faded to black.

The scene shifts as he wakes up, finding himself in a haunted mansion filled with old, dusty furniture and eerie family portraits. The door creaks shut behind him, and an unnatural chill fills the air. On a nearby table, he notices a red envelope and a photograph of a young woman. As he approaches it, the soft sound of footsteps echoes from the hallway, belonging to the girl's family. Upon realizing that he has been forced into marriage with a dead woman, he struggles and desperately tries to escape, all while the girl in the portrait above the altar on the wall laughs with satisfaction.

And then the story begins, the boys have to find all the ways to escape from the chair where he has been pinioned,.....

## **Step-by-Step Gameplay Example:**
1. Exploration & Interaction:
+ Player's Action: The player, using the first-person perspective, carefully walks around the room, examining objects for clues. They check drawers, bookshelves, and paintings for hidden messages or useful items.
+ Mechanics in Play: The player interacts with objects by clicking on them. Some objects can be moved, while others reveal hidden compartments. For example, pulling a specific book might open a secret passage, but the player doesn’t know which one yet.

2. Supernatural Event:
+ Player's Action: As the player examines the room, the lights flicker, and a vase falls off a shelf by itself. Suddenly, a low whisper echoes through the room, warning the player that the spirit is near.
+ Mechanics in Play: The supernatural event is triggered by a timer or the player’s progress. The game intensifies with unsettling environmental changes, adding to the fear and urgency. A ghostly figure may appear in a corner of the room for a split second, creating a jump scare and putting pressure on the player to act quickly.

3. Puzzle Solving:
+ Player's Action: The player notices a strange symbol on the photograph they found earlier. Upon examining a nearby locked cabinet, they see the same symbol. They deduce that the combination for the lock must be hidden somewhere in the room.
+ Mechanics in Play: The player finds an old journal containing cryptic numbers and symbols scattered across its pages. They have to match these symbols with various objects in the room (e.g., a painting, an antique clock) to find the correct code for the lock. This involves critical thinking and careful observation.

4. Tension Rises:
+ Player's Action: While solving the puzzle, the player hears footsteps approaching the door. They realize the ghost or a family member might be near. The player quickly hides in a wardrobe to avoid being caught.
+ Mechanics in Play: The stealth mechanics are activated. The player must stay hidden and avoid making noise as the ghostly presence searches the room. They can peek through a crack in the wardrobe to watch as the door opens and the entity briefly enters, looking for them. If they make a sound, the ghost could discover them, and they’ll have to either run or face the consequences.

5. Completing the Puzzle & Escape:
+ Player's Action: Once the ghost leaves, the player quickly inputs the code they’ve discovered into the cabinet’s lock. It clicks open, revealing a key to a secret door hidden behind a large painting.
+ Mechanics in Play: After solving the puzzle, the player uses the key to unlock a hidden passageway. They now have the choice to proceed into the unknown or stay and search the room for more clues about the girl’s past.
6. Chase Sequence (Optional):
Player's Action: As the player enters the secret passage, the ghost reappears and chases them. The player sprints down the narrow hallway, knocking over objects to slow the ghost’s pursuit.
Mechanics in Play: The game switches to a more intense sequence, where the player must navigate a maze of corridors under pressure. They must avoid dead ends while looking for a safe room to hide in. If caught, the game could present a quick-time event (QTE) where the player has a chance to escape or suffer a haunting consequence.

## **OutCome  :** 
The player successfully escapes the immediate danger but is now deeper inside the haunted mansion. They've unlocked more of the house's secrets, but they’re also more entangled in the sinister ghost marriage ritual. The environment becomes increasingly hostile as they progress, and new challenges await.
